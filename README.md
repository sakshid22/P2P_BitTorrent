# P2P_BitTorrent
In this project, we designed a P2P file sharing software similar to BitTorrent. BitTorrent is a popular P2P protocol for file distribution. Among its interesting features, we implemented the choking-unchoking mechanism which is one of the most important features of BitTorrent. All operations were assumed to be implemented using a reliable transport protocol (i.e. TCP). The interaction between two peers was symmetrical: Messages sent in both directions look the same. The protocol consisted of a handshake followed by a never-ending stream of length- prefixed messages. Whenever a connection was established between two peers, each of the peers of the connection sent a handshake message before sending other messages and thus the networking was established.
